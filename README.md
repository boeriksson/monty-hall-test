## Monty Hall test
SpringBoot setup that publish a rest api togeather with integration tests that validate the probability of the 3-doors setup. 

### Basic problem
You have 3 options, where only one is right. You select one of the options, then some external party - wise to where the right option is, shows you one of the wrong ones that you did not choose. 

The question is: would you benafit from switching to the one remaining option that the external party didnt reveal, rather than sticking with your firsthand choice?
